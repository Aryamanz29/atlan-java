# Introduction to SDKs

Our Software Development Kits (SDKs) are API client libraries. They:

- Provide the means to programmatically interact with Atlan
	- Using constructs that are the most comfortable for a given programming language
	- Including error-handling mechanisms, such as checked exceptions
- Abstract away the need to worry about underlying REST API communications (HTTP protocols, methods, headers, endpoint URLs, etc)
- Remove the need to directly understand and translate complex JSON structures for request and response payloads
