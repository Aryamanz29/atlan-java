# Key concepts in Atlan

There are some key concepts in Atlan you should be familiar with, irrespective of the language for the SDK.

## Entities and assets

In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as *assets*. We may also refer to these as *entities*. Strictly speaking entities can be a slightly more abstract concept, as it may include objects that do not provide data context. (For example, we may capture persona and purpose information as entities, but the persona or purpose itself is not an asset.)

For every object you're likely to interact with, though, the two can be thought of as synonymous.
